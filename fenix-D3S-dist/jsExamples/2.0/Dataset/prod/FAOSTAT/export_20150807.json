The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products. From these values and the available population estimates, the per person dietary energy and protein and fat supplies are derived and expressed on a daily basis. In the FBS production data refer only to primary products while data for all other elements also include processed products derived there from, expressed in primary commodity equivalent.\r\n\r\nELEMENTS:\r\nFat supply quantity [g/capita/day]\r\nFood supply [kcal/capita/day]\r\nFood supply quantity [g/capita/day]\r\nFood supply quantity [kg/capita/yr]\r\nFood supply quantity [t]\r\nProtein supply quantity [g/capita/day]\r\n\r\n"

The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products.

      "EN" : "For FAO: Article I of its Constitution requires FAO to \"collect, analyse, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture.\" The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: “If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” (http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5584e/x5584e00.htm).   Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000.  Within FAO's statistical program of work, member countries endorsed the development of consumer food price statistics during meetings of three statutory bodies:  the Asia and Pacific Commision on Agricultural Statistics (APCAS) held in Vietnam in February 2014; the African Commision on Agricultural Statistics (AFCAS) held in Morocco in December 2013; and the IICA working group on agricultural and livestock statistics for Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Trinidad and Tobago in June 2013. \r\nFor the International Labour Organization (ILO):  \"In many countries, CPIs were first compiled mainly in order to be able to adjust wages to compensate for the loss of purchasing power caused by inflation. Consequently, the responsibility for compiling CPIs was often entrusted to ministries, or departments, of labour. The International Conference of Labour Statisticians (ICLS), convened by the Governing Body of the ILO, therefore provided the natural forum in which to discuss CPI methodology and develop guidelines.\" (from the CPI Handbook, available at http://www.ilo.org).  Currently the CPI is widely used to measure and monitor inflation, set monetary policy targets, index social benefits such as pensions and unemployment benefits, and as escalators used in income tax systems and public and private wage contracts.  As a result, a large number of international organizations compile and publish CPIs for their member countries, including the International Monetery Fund, the OECD, and Eurostat.   \r\n"

      "EN" : "General notes:  Ammonia (NH3) emissions are strongly related with animal farms and are associated, as a driving force, with acidification and eutrophication. Agriculture is the main source of ammonia emissions, with shares ranging on average between 80% and 99%. Ammonia with sulphur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) contribute to acidification of soil and water when it combines with water in the atmosphere or after deposition. Deposition of ammonia can also raise nitrogen levels in soil and water, which may contribute to eutrophication in receiving aquatic ecosystems. Deposited ammonia can also contribute to the emissions of nitrous oxide, which is a GHG. Ammonia in the atmosphere can also combine with industrial and transport pollution generating secondary particulate pollution. Indicator: Ammonia (NH3) emissions from agriculture as a % of total NH3 emissions. Methodology: Share Ammonia from agriculture/total Ammonia emissions (%): (Total Ammonia emissions from agriculture)/(Total Ammonia emissions) * 100.

      "EN" : "\"ENERGY USE:  Agriculture consumes energy directly for crop and livestock production (machinery, etc) but also indirectly through fertilizers and pesticides. Agriculture also produces energy as biofuels and biomass production. As an energy user, Agriculture contributes to global warming (mainly through CO2 emissions, but also CH4 and N2O emissions), air pollution (mainly through NOx and SO2 emissions) and to the depletion of fossil energy resources. Important energy users are glasshouse horticulture, floriculture and dairy production. Agriculture can make a contribution to the mitigation of climate change and air pollution effects through more efficient energy use and through the production of renewable energy (bio-energy production). Indicator: Agriculture and forestry energy used as a % of total energy use, measured as Agr.Energy use/Total Energy Use)*100. \r\nBIOENERGY: Bioenergy refers to energy derived from the biological carbon fixation of plants or from biological tissues. Examples are biodiesel, derived from vegetable oils and animal fats, and bioethanol, produced by the fermentation of carbohydrates of crops like corn.  The production of biomass for energy production has important effects on rural development, international policy and economy, and on the environment: it supports the rural economy creating jobs and gives farmers a source of income complementary to food production. Biofuels have also an impact on economy and trade, since they reduce the dependence on oil-producing countries. Being derived from plants, their production contributes to carbon sequestration.  Biofuels production presents also some issues, such as the increased pressure on water resources, deforestation (to clear land to cultivate fuel crops), and the change in use of land originally intended for food production. Indicator: Bioenergy production as a % of total energy production. Methodology: Sum of different bioenergy (e.g. biodiesel, biogases).

Fertilizers can have a negative impact on the environment, leading to eutrophication and poisoning of water, and pollution of soil (e.g. heavy metals, soil acidification, POP-Persistent Organic Pollutants). Also, the production of fertilizers is energy intensive and mineable phosphorus reserves are finite.\r\nAbout the Fertilizer module:  The Fertilizer dataset contains summary data from 2002 onwards. This dataset has been prepared using a revised methodology and new dissemination formats starting in 2006. The previous fertilizer data series in FAOSTAT (data from 1961 to 2002) can be found in the Fertilizer Archive. The two sets should be used separately and not combined in order to create longer time series. This is due to the following changes from 2002 including: a change in the underlying fertilizer data methodology; the move to the use of calendar rather than a mixture of calendar and fertilizer year; revised classification of the fertilizer items; the addition of the non-fertilizer use parameter in the fertilizer balance and the use of new data sources for some data (e.g. UN COMTRADE). The fertilizer statistics data are generally received from individual countries in product weight through the new FAO Questionnaire on Agricultural Resources – Fertilizers and then converted to nutrients and validated for consistency regarding summary totals of production, import, export, non-fertilizer use and consumption for the three types of fertilizers: nitrogen (N), phosphate (P205), potash (K20) and including complex fertilizers (NP, PK, NK and NPK).\r\nAbout the Fertilizer Trade Values module: The Fertilizer Trade Values contains data from 1961 onwards. This dataset has been prepared from detailed fertilizer imports and exports statistics reported by national statistical authorities, The United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN Comtrade) and Eurostat. All values are in 1000 US Dollars (1000 $). Please note that differences between exports and imports are mainly due to: 1.the time lag between the date when the exports are recorded and the date of their entry into the importing countries; 2.the time reference period: some exporting countries report for the calendar year while the corresponding importing countries report for the fertilizer year, and vice versa; 3.the different statistical systems used in reporting intermediate material. \r\n\r\nIndicators: Nitrogen Fertilizers use per arable land and permanent crop area (N tonnes / 1000 Ha);  Phosphate Fertilizers use per arable land and permanent crop area (P205 tonnes / 1000 Ha);  Nitrogen + Phosphate Fertilizers use per arable land and permanent crop area (N+P205 tonnes / 1000 Ha). \r\nSee also FAOSTAT metadata on Fertilizers and Land for further details.\"\r\n"

      "EN" : "\"Erosion is the process by which soil is removed from a certain region due to the action of natural factors (wind, water, ice), of livingorganisms, and of gravity. Erosion is a natural process, but human activities can greatly influence its rate, especially through agriculture and deforestation. According to the U.N. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment, approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded. In natural conditions, only very severe meteorological events will cause erosion, as the vegetation cover, the leaf litter and the organic matter will protect the soil absorbing rain impacts and preventing soil removal. Removal of the natural vegetation cover due to practices such as: deforestation; overgrazing; or industrial farming practices (e.g. tillage), leaves the soil exposed to the action of climatic factors, such as rain and wind. \r\nThe global survey on human-induced soil degradation is the GLASOD (Global Assessment of Human-Induced Soil Degradation), prepared jointly by ISRIC and UNEP during the 1980’s. The GLASOD database is the only global dataset available on soil degradation. However, there are issues related to its quality, which is not homogeneous, and therefore statistics obtained from these maps are not always reliable (Sonneveld and Dent 2007). Better statistics on soil degradation will be possible with the new version of the FAO GLADIS dataset which should be released shortly. \r\nSoil quality can be defined as “the capacity of a specific kind of soil to function, within natural or managed ecosystem boundaries, to sustain plant and animal productivity, maintain or enhance water and air quality, and support human health and habitation. \r\nSoil quality is defined according to the soil functions (e.g. bearing function, production function, habitat function, resources function, reactor function) and cannot be measured by a single parameter. However, soil organic carbon has been defined by EUROSTAT as the more appropriate indicator for soil quality. High organic carbon content corresponds to good conditions from an agro-environmental point of view. Soils with organic carbon content less than 1% in weight are generally affected by soil degradation processes and erosion. On the other hand, soils with 1-10% organic carbon content have high agricultural value.\r\nThe data used for the production of this indicator are geo-spatial raster data contained in the Harmonized World Soil Database (HWSD) released by FAO, IIASA, ISRIC, ISSCAS, and JRC in 2008 with a spatial resolution of 30 by 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 Km). Spatial data were extracted through appropriate queries from the geo-database and then spatial statistics were calculated at the country level.\r\n\"\r\n"

      "EN" : "\"The agricultural sector uses a considerable share of the available water resources. An increase of irrigated area in a country or region could imply an increase of water use for agriculture. Knowing that a certain area is equipped to be irrigated does not mean that it has been irrigated in a specific year. The indicator Agricultural Water Withdrawal assesses the total amount of water used for irrigation. Irrigation represents the main use of water in agriculture and one of the main uses of water resources in general. Trends in water abstraction may depend on several factors, such as crop type, irrigation technology, water prices, and climatic conditions. Agricultural water withdrawal is a serious concern especially in arid and semi-arid areas, where water is scarce and highly variable from year to year. In dry regions it is necessary to irrigate certain crops to obtain reasonable yields. In addition to lower income for the farmer, low yields will also mean that less fertilizer nitrogen is removed from the fields with harvested crops, and thereby leaving excess nitrogen (N) in the soil resulting in potentially higher risk for leaching during the following period. Furthermore, increased water abstraction may also cause salinisation and contamination of water with other pollutants.\r\nThe indicator in EUROSTAT and OECD frameworks: Eurostat: AEI n.20. OECD: AEI n.1\r\nDefinition in the original frameworks: EUROSTAT: Main indicator: Share of agriculture in water use; supporting indicator; Water use for irrigation (m3/yr). OECD: Pesticide use (or sales) in terms of tonnes of active ingredients and related trends. \r\nData used in the original frameworks:\r\nEUROSTAT: Farm Structural Survey (FSS), OECD/Eurostat Joint Questionnaire on Inland Waters, AQUASTAT, JRC Database (Water use for irrigation), Water Fram.Dir. reporting.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.\r\n",

Using these data and the available information on seed rates, waste coefficients, stock changes and types of utilization (feed, food, processing and other utilization), a supply/utilization account is prepared for each commodity in weight terms. The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products. From these values and the available population estimates, the per person dietary energy and protein and fat supplies are derived and expressed on a daily basis.

(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/pdf/4_Volume4/V4_11_Ch11_N2O&CO2.pdf).\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGreenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from crop residues consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from nitrogen (N) in crop residues and forage/pasture renewal left on agricultural fields by farmers. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the deposition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2 and 11. \r\n\r\nDirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF     \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in units of kg N2O yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of N in crop residues in kg N yr-1, (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data are calculated from Crop yield and harvested area and cover for the following crop categories: Barley, Beans-dry, Maize, Millet, Oats, Potatoes, Rice-paddy, Rye, Sorghum, Soybeans, and Wheat. Crop yield and harvested area are used to estimate the amount of biomass N in above and below-ground residues by crop and by country, using IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Eq. 11.6 default crop values in Tab. 11.2. In a few cases where default parameters were not provided (N content of below-ground residues for Rice and Millet, and Ratio of below-ground residues to above-ground biomass for Millet, Sorghum, Rye, and Dry bean) the correspondent default values for crops with similar biophysical characteristics were used. This biomass N amount is then reduced by the fraction of crop residue burnt on site—assumed to be 10% by area, following IPCC, 2000: Ch. 4, Section 4A.2.1.1 —with specified combustion coefficients by crop, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.6. Finally, all N in crop residues, net of amount burnt, is assumed to remain on the field, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Eq. 11.6. \r\nFor the period 1961-present, Crop yield and harvested area are taken from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Crops). Projections of crop yield and harvested area for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighbouring countries.\r\n\r\n(2) Global default EF values taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nIndirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF where:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions, in units of Gg N2O yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the fraction of N in crop residues forage/pasture renewal that is lost through runoff and leaching in kg N yr-1 (3);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N / kg N yr-1 (4).\r\n\r\n(3) Obtained through the leaching factor in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11,Tab. 11.3.  \r\n\r\n(4) Global IPCC default EF values from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-3, to convert the activity data from kg to tonnes;\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg N2O to Gg N2O; and\r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.

See 20.5 for more details\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGreenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions from burning crop residues consist of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases produced by the combustion of a percentage of crop residues burnt on-site. The mass of fuel available for burning should be estimated taking into account the fractions removed before burning due to animal consumption, decay in the field, and use in other sectors (e.g., biofuel, domestic livestock feed, building materials, etc.). The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2 and 5. \r\n\r\nThe CH4 and N2O emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in units of g CH4 and g N2O;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of biomass burned, kg of dry matter (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in gr CH4/kg of dry matter and g N2O/kg of dry matter (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data are calculated from harvested area statistics and cover the following crops: wheat, maize, rice, and sugarcane. For the period 1961-present, harvested area is taken from FAOSTAT (domain Production/crops). Projections of harvested area for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\nHarvested area is used to estimate the amount of biomass burned using mean default crop values of mass of fuel available for combustion (MB) and combustion factor (Cf) in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.4. The mass is then reduced by the fraction of crop residue burnt on-site—assumed to be 10%, following IPCC, 2000: Ch.4, Section 4A.2.1.1.\r\n\r\n(2) Global default EF values taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.5.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4  and g N2O to Gg N2O;\r\nGWP- CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq and                 \r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.

They are those associated with carbon losses from drained organic soils. The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 5.\r\n\r\nThe emissions are estimated at pixel level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = Annual emissions, in units of tonnes C yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the annual area of cultivated organic soils, in hectares (1).\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of tonnes C ha-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Data are obtained through the stratification of two different global datasets:\r\ni. The Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), used to estimate the area covered by Histosols classes. \r\nii. The Global Land Cover dataset, GLC2000 (EC-JRC, 2003), used to estimate the amount of cropland and grassland area in each pixel. \r\n\r\nFor cropland, three “cropland” classes from GLC2000 are used following You et al. (2008):\r\n \r\nCLASS - NAME - CROPLAND SHARE PER PIXEL\r\n16 - Cultivated and managed areas - 100%\r\n17 - Mosaic: cropland/tree cover/Other natural vegetation - 50%\r\n18 - Mosaic: cropland/Shrub and/or grass cover - 10%\r\n\r\nFor the period 1990-present, the activity data reported in this sub-domain are a constant value, representing the year 2000, i.e., the reference year of the GLC2000 database.\r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those specified in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 5, Tab. 5.6. The EF were assigned at pixel level to the relevant climate zone, as defined in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 3, Annex 3A.5. The climatic zones map used has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010), following the IPCC prescriptions.\r\n\r\nThe analysis was carried out is GIS, combining the above datasets, and the global emissions dataset was summarized by country. Dimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/12, to convert the emissions from tonnes C to tonnes CO2 gas;\r\n10-3, to convert the emissions from tonnes C to Gg C\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n- EC-JRC. 2003.

See 20.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from enteric fermentation consist of methane gas (CH4) produced in digestive systems of ruminants and to a lesser extent of non-ruminants. The FAOSTAT emission data are computed at Tier 1, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 4, Ch. 10.\r\nThe emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions, in kg CH4 yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing number of livestock in heads (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of kg CH4 head-1 * yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data cover the following animal categories: buffaloes, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, pigs, dairy and non-dairy cattle*. For the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Live animals). Projections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 for the following categories: dairy and non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n*FAOSTAT livestock data include cattle and dairy cattle. Dairy cattle data are expressed as heads of cows producing milk, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item Milk, whole fresh cow and the element Producing animals. Non-dairy cattle is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as: cattle minus dairy cattle.\r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those specified by livestock category and regional grouping in IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch.10, Tabs. 10.10 and 10.11.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg CH4 to Gg CH4; and \r\nGWP-CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1995: Technical Summary, Tab. 4, page 22 ). \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.

Activity data for intermediate years in the FAOSTAT emission database are calculated yearly through linear interpolation of data from the FRA database.\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available (i.e. in non-FRA years) , a linear interpolation of data is operated. In other cases (lack of geographic coverage), no imputations are made and the FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data.\r\n\r\nNet CO2 emissions/removals from Forest Land consist of net carbon stock change in the living biomass pool (aboveground and belowground) associated with: i) Forest, referring to changes occurred on Forest Land in the reported year; and ii) Net Forest conversion from Forest Land to other land uses. The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1, with the stock difference method, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 4, Ch. 2 and 4.\r\n\r\nThe net CO2 emission/removal, E/R, are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nE/R = A * CSCF *(-44/12) * (1/1,000)\r\nwhere:\r\nE/R= Net CO2 emission/removal, in Gg CO2 yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the forest area under forest management or the forest area net change, in ha (1);\r\nCSCF = per hectare carbon stock change in the living biomass pool (aboveground + belowground) of forest land, expressed in units of t C/ha (2);\r\n\r\n(1) Area of forest, A, is calculated from annual areas of forest land taken directly from the Global Forest Resource Assessment (FRA) of FAO. Data for the year 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010, as provided by FRA, for categories Primary forest, Other naturally regenerated forest and Planted forest were linearly interpolated to compile, for each country, complete timeseries of areas for each category, for the period 1990-2010. FRA categories Primary forest and Other naturally regenerated forest were aggregated, while Planted forest were considered separately, to compute the following forest area components at year t:\r\na. Area of forest that was still forest in the previous year (area type SFA), computed as Min [A(t), A(t-1)];\r\nb. For Forest, new net area converted to forest in the same year (area type NAD), computed as: Max[A(t)-A(t-1),0], thus including only positive net forest area change; or\r\nc. For Net Forest Conversion: net area loss converted from forest to other land uses (area type NAD), computed as: Min[A(t)-A(t-1),0] ], thus including only positive net forest area change.\r\n\r\n(2) CSCF is computed from the per hectare carbon stock in the living biomass (aboveground + belowground) pool in the country in year t, b(t). The latter is obtained from data on per hectare carbon stocks taken directly from the FRA database for the years 1990, 2000, 2005 and 2010. These were linearly interpolated to compile, for each country, a complete timeseries of per hectare average carbon stock in the living biomass pool, b(t), for the period 1990-2010. For countries for which FRA carbon stock data were not available, the relevant FRA regional carbon stock (table 2.21 of FRA 2010) was applied. \r\nFor each year t, and each forest area type above, the CSCF is calculated as follows:\r\n\r\nFor Forest:\r\n\r\ni.   CSCF(t, SFA) = Db (t) = b(t) – b(t-1),  for forest are of type SFA (D= delta);\r\nii. CSCF*(t, NAD) = b (t)  , for forest areas of type NAD.\r\n\r\nThe overall net carbon stock change factor at year t, CSCF(t), is computed as: \r\nCSCF(t) = [CSCF(t,SFA)*SFA + CSCF(t,NAD)*NAD]/A\r\n\r\nFor Net Forest Conversion:\r\n\r\ni. CSCF*(t, NAD) = b (t-1)  , for forest areas of type NAD.\r\n\r\nThe overall net carbon stock change factor at year t, CSCF(t), is computed as: \r\nCSCF(t) = CSCF(t,NAD)*NAD/A \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used were:\r\n-44/12, to convert from carbon mass to CO2 emissions; and\r\n10-3, to convert tons in Gg.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nFAO, 2010.

See 20.5 for more details.\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions data from grassland are currently limited to emissions from grassland organic soils. They are those associated with carbon losses from drained organic soils. The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 6.\r\n\r\nThe emissions are estimated at pixel level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = Annual emissions, in units of tonnes C yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the annual area of grassland organic soils, in hectares (1).\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of tonnes C ha-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Data are obtained through the stratification of two different global datasets:\r\ni. The Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), used to estimate the area covered by Histosols classes. \r\nii. The Global Land Cover dataset, GLC2000 (EC-JRC, 2003), used to estimate the amount of cropland and grassland area in each pixel. \r\n\r\nFor grassland, two “herbaceous” and two mosaics GLC2000 classes are used, in line with the FAO Land Cover Classification Scheme (LCCS):\r\n\r\nCLASS - NAME - GRASSLAND SHARE PER PIXEL\r\n13 - Herbaceous Cover, closed-open - 100%\r\n14 - Sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub cover - 50%\r\n17 - Mosaic: Cropland/Tree Cover/Other natural vegetation - 25%\r\n18 - Mosaic: Cropland/Shrub and/or grass cover - 45%\r\n\r\niii. The Gridded Livestock of the World for cattle and sheep (Wint and Robinson, 2007), used as an additional mask over grassland histosols as a proxy to estimate drained area. With this mask, only those pixels with non-zero grassland histosols area and livestock density >1 head/ha are included.\r\nFor the period 1990-present, the activity data reported in this sub-domain are a constant value, representing the year 2000, i.e., the reference year of the GLC2000 database.\r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those specified in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 6, Tab. 6.3. The EF were assigned at pixel level to the relevant climate zone, as defined in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 3, Annex 3A.5. The climatic zones map used has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010), following the IPCC prescriptions.\r\n\r\nThe analysis was carried out in GIS, combining the above datasets, and the global emissions dataset was summarized by country. Dimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/12, to convert the emissions from tonnes C to tonnes CO2 gas;\r\n10-3, to convert the emissions from tonnes C to Gg C\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nEC-JRC. 2003.

The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.27. \r\n\r\nCH4 and N2O emissions are estimated on a spatial grid at 0.25 degree resolution (approximately 25 km at the equator),  using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\n\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in g CH4 and g N2O;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total mass of fuel burned in each pixel, kg of dry matter (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1 IPCC emission factor, expressed in g CH4 or g N2O per kg of burned dry matter (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Total mass of fuel burned is computed by multiplying burned area (i) by fuel biomass consumption values (ii).\r\n\r\n(i) Yearly composite burned area values are produced from monthly statistics of the Global Fire Emission Database v.4, based on MODIS remote-sensing data (GFED4; Giglio et al. 2013). The dataset provides burned area by land cover classes as identified by the MODIS Land Cover product (MCD12Q1, Hansen et al., 2000). \r\n\r\n(ii) Fuel biomass consumption values were assigned at pixel level to the relevant climate zone, as defined in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.4. The climatic zones map used has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010), following the IPCC prescriptions.  \r\nThe data period available on FAOSTAT is 1990 to present with annual updates, and projections to 2030 and 2050. Since GFED4 data are not available before 1996 and obviously for future periods, yearly values for the period 1990-1995, as well as 2030 and 2050, are set as a constant, and estimated as the average of the period 1996-2012. \r\n\r\n(2) Default EF values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.5.\r\nGHG estimates made at pixel level were subsequently aggregated at country level,using the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4  and g N2O to Gg N2O;\r\nGWP- CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq.                 \r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nEC-JRC 2010.

They consist of methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and, only in the case of Organic Soils, also Carbon Dioxide (CO2). \r\nHumid Tropical Forest is defined by aggregation of the following FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones (FAO 2012): “Tropical rainforest” and ‘’Tropical moist deciduous forest”.\r\n\r\nOther Forest area contains the rest of the FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones for Forest.\r\n\r\nOrganic Soils are defined as the Histosols class in the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), consistently with the FAOSTAT Emissions database ‘’Cultivation Organic Soils’’ definitions. \r\n\r\nEmissions are estimated following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Eq. 2.27, by aggregation to the national level of spatially distributed information, produced on a spatial grid at 0.25 degree resolution (approximately 25 km at the equator). \r\n\r\nFor each item, and at each pixel, the following formula is used: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\n\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in g CH4 , g N2O and g CO2.\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total mass of fuel burned, in kg of dry matter (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1 IPCC emission factor, expressed in g CH4 , g N2O or g CO2 , per kg of burned dry matter (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Total mass of fuel burned is computed by multiplying burned area (i) by fuel biomass consumption values (ii).\r\n\r\n(i) Yearly composite values of burned area are obtained as the sum of monthly burned area data from the Global Fire Emission Database v.4 (GFED4; Giglio et al. 2013). For forest, the GFED4 burned forest area is an aggregate of burned area in the following MODIS land cover classes (MCD12Q1, Hansen et al., 2000): Evergreen Needle-leaf, Evergreen Broadleaf, Deciduous Needle-leaf, Deciduous Broadleaf, and Mixed Forest. \r\nFor ‘’Humid Tropical Forest,’’ burned area is obtained by overlapping GFED4 Burned Forest area data with the relevant FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones.\r\nFor ‘’Other Forest,’’ burned area is obtained as GFED4 burned Forest area minus Humid Tropical Forest burned area.\r\nFor “Organic Soils,’’ burned areas is obtained by overlapping GFED4 Burned area data with the Histosols class information of the Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), assuming even distribution of organic soils within the grid cell. \r\n\r\n(ii) Fuel biomass consumption values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.4. The different values are climate dependent, and were geographically allocated using the JRC Climate Zones map (EC-JRC, 2010).\r\n\r\n(2) EF values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 2, Tab. 2.5. The different values were assigned at pixel level to the relevant climate zone. The climatic zones map used has been developed by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010), following the IPCC prescriptions.\r\nFor each item, Emissions at pixel level were subsequently aggregated at country level, using the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4  and g N2O to Gg N2O;\r\nGWP- CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq.                 \r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nEC-JRC 2010.

Projections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 for the following categories: dairy and non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n*FAOSTAT livestock data include the items cattle and dairy cattle. Dairy cattle data are expressed as heads of cows producing milk, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item milk, whole fresh cow and the element producing animals. Non-dairy cattle is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as cattle minus dairy cattle;\r\n\r\n**FAOSTAT livestock data include the items chicken and chicken layers. Chicken layers are expressed in 1000 heads of hens which have laid eggs in the reference period, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item eggs, hen, in shell and the element producing animals. Chickens broilers is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as chickens minus chickens layers;\r\n\r\n***FAOSTAT livestock data include the item pigs. Market and breeding swine are calculated respectively as 90% and 10% of item pigs (IPCC, 2006, Vol.4, Ch.10, Tab.10.19).\r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are assigned to each country (IPCC, 2006: Tab. 10.14 for cattle, buffaloes and pigs and Tab. 10.15 for all other animals), as a function of country-level average annual temperature (⁰C). Average annual temperatures by country are taken from the FAO Global Agro-Ecological Zones (GAEZ) dataset (IIASA/FAO, 2012), relative to the baseline period 1961-1990. \r\n\r\nDirect N2O emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of N in manure treated in manure management systems (MMS) in kg N yr-1 (3); \r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (4).\r\n\r\n(3) It is the total amount of N excreted (i) for each livestock categories (ii) treated in MMS (iii).\r\n\r\n(i) Following IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10 Eq. 10.30, the total amount of N excreted by each livestock category is calculated multiplying the number of livestock heads by two coefficients: a) the Typical Animal Mass (TAM) and b) the N excretion coefficient (Nex). Both parameters vary according to geographic region. TAM values are obtained from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2, Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9; Nex values are derived from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.19.\r\n\r\n(ii) see (1) for the livestock categories.\r\n\r\n(iii) Default IPCC percentages of total N treated in different MMS, by region and livestock category, are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9 (for poultry: IPCC, 1997: Ch.4 Tab. 4.21). \r\n\r\n(4) The EF values depend on the specific MMS, as per IPCC 2006, Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.21. \r\n\r\nIndirect N2O emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the fraction of total amount of nitrogen (N) in manure treated in MMS that volatizes as NH3 and NOx and is lost through runoff and leaching, in kg N yr-1 (5); \r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (6).\r\n\r\n(5) The fractions for volatilization by animal and MMS are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.22. A mean fraction value of 10% for all countries is used for leaching (IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 10, note to Eq. 10.28).\r\n\r\n(6) All countries are assigned global default EF values for volatilization and leaching (IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.3).\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert kg to Gg; and\r\nGWP-CH4 = 21 and GWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 or Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq.

          "EN" : "FAOSTAT Emissions data are computed based on a number of source data as listed in 13.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from direct energy use consist of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gases associated with fuel burning and generation of electricity used in agriculture (including fisheries). The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1, following IPCC 2006 Vol. 2, Ch. 2 and 3 with the exception of the country emission factors electricity-only (see below).\r\nData are estimated per main energy carrier (fuels and electricity) used in agriculture, for the following energy carriers: Motor gasoline; Gas-Diesel oil; Natural gas; Residual fuel oil; Liquefied petroleum gas; Coal and Electricity; and per selected agriculture sub-domains (i.e. irrigation, fisheries). Renewable energy for electricity contributes to the GHG emission calculation indirectly, via country emission factors, which depend on a country’s energy mix for electricity generation.\r\n\r\nThe emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nA = Activity data, representing the amount of fuel consumed in Kt (1,000 metric tons) yr-1, TJ (terajoule) yr-1 or ktoe (k tons of oil equivalent) yr-1 for fuels, and GWh yr-1 for electricity (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed as kg of gas emitted per terajoule (for fuels) or gram per kilowatt hour (for electricity) of energy used per year (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data relative to fuels are taken from the United Nations Statistics Division (UNSD) Energy Statistics database; data relative to fuels used in fisheries, specifically “Gas-Diesel oil used in fisheries” and “Residual fuel oil used in fisheries” are taken from the International Energy Agency (IEA) database “World energy balances”; finally for energy used for power irrigation the irrigated area is taken from FAO AQUASTAT (*). The activity data (**) cover the following:\r\na. Gas-Diesel oil (incl. fisheries);\r\nb. Motor gasoline;\r\nc. Natural gas (incl. Liquefied Natural Gas);\r\nd. Liquefied petroleum gas;\r\ne. Residual fuel oil (incl. fisheries);\r\nf. Coal (Other bituminous coal or, if not available, Hard coal);\r\ng. Electricity;\r\nh. Gas-diesel oil used in fisheries;\r\ni. Residual fuel oil used in fisheries;\r\nj. Energy for power irrigation\r\n\r\n(*) The irrigated area considered is the sum of “Total area equipped for full control irrigation: sprinkler” and “Total area equipped for full control irrigation: localized” taken from the FAO AQUASTAT database. Annual values in FAOSTAT are estimated by repeating the last-available value reported in AQUASTAT within the associated time interval. Regional factors indicating the energy needed to irrigate one hectare of land (Stout, 1990) have been applied to estimate the energy consumed for irrigation. Specifically: Europe, Northern America, Oceania: 1,929 kWh/ha; Africa, Asia: 2,411 kWh/ha; Central America, South America, Caribbean: 2,170 kWh/ha.\r\n\r\n(**) For a., b., d., e. and f. the amount of energy from the mass of fuels was derived using the Net Calorific Values reported in IPCC 2006, Vol. 2, Ch. 1, Tab. 1.2; \r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those reported by energy carrier in IPCC 2006, Vol. 2, Ch. 2, Tab.2.5 and Ch.3, Tab 3.31. A summary table is shown below:\r\nEnergy carrier - Use - CO2 - CH4 - N2O - kg/TJ\r\nGas/Diesel oil - Mobile - 74,100 - 4.15 - 28.6\r\nMotor gasoline - Mobile - 69,300 - 80 - 2\r\nNatural gas liquids - Stationary - 64,200 - 10 - 0.6\r\nResidual fuel oil -Stationary - 77,400 - 10 - 0.6\r\nLiquefied petroleum gases - Stationary - 63,100 - 5 - 0.1\r\nCoal (Other Bituminous Coal) - Stationary - 94,600 - 300 - 1.5\r\n\r\nFor electricity, country emission factors for CO2, namely electricity-only factors, are those reported by IEA (OECD/IEA, 2012). They are based on 1996 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 1990 country emission factors are applied to previous years. Non-CO2 emissions factors for electricity used for all countries are estimated on the basis the IEA global electricity emission factor for CO2, considering these emissions as a fraction of the CO2 emitted (CH4: 300/98300 for coal, 5/56100 for natural gas, 10/73300 for crude oil; N2O: 1.5/98300 for coal, 0.1/56100 for natural gas, 0.6/73300 for crude oil) and an energy mix for electricity as follows: 48% coal, 22% natural gas, 6% crude oil. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-6, to convert kg to Gg; and\r\nGWP-CH4= 21; GWP-N2O= 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 or Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq.

      "EN" : "\"GHG emissions from manure left on pastures consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure nitrogen (N) left on pastures by grazing livestock. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the deposition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). \r\nFAOSTAT emission estimates are computed at Tier 1 following the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html).\r\nGHG emissions are provided by country, regions and special grpoups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1961-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed as direct, indirect and total Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq, by livestock species (asses, buffaloes, camels, cattle (dairy and non-dairy), chickens (broilers and layers), ducks, goats, horses, llamas, mules, sheep, swine (breeding, market), turkeys) and by species aggregates (all animals, camels and llamas, cattle, chickens, mules and asses, poultry birds, sheep and goats, swine). Implied emission factor for N2O and N content in manure are also provided.\"\r\n\r\n\"This domain contains data on GHG emissions, associated emission factors and underlying activity data. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions database was produced by the FAO Monitoring and Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Potential in Agriculture project (MAGHG), with generous funding from the Governments of Norway and Germany, trust funds GCP/GLO/286/GER and GCP/GLO/325/NOR.\"\r\n\r\n"

          "EN" : "FAOSTAT Emissions data are  computed based on Activity Data from other FAOSTAT domains (Production \\ Live animals \\  asses, buffaloes, camelids (other), camels, cattle, chickens, goats, horses, mules, pigs, sheep, turkeys) as well as Production \\ Livestock Primary \\ Eggs, hen in shell, milk, whole fresh cow) and on conversion factors in IPCC 2006 guidelines (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html). See 20.5 for more details.\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from manure left on pastures consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure nitrogen (N) left on pastures by grazing livestock. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the deposition site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following the IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nDirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF     \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of manure N left on pasture in kg N yr-1 (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Computed as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Eq. 11.5, as the amount of total N excreted (see below, note i) by livestock (ii) and left on pastures as urine and dung (iii).\r\n\r\n(i) Following IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Eq. 10.30, the total amount of nitrogen excreted in manure is calculated, for each livestock category, by the number of livestock heads by two coefficients: a) the Typical Animal Mass (TAM) and b) the N excretion coefficient (Nex). Both parameters vary according to geographic region. TAM values are obtained from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9; Nex values are derived from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.19. \r\n\r\n(ii) Livestock data cover the following animal categories: buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, ducks, turkeys, dairy and non-dairy cattle*, chickens layers and broilers** and market and breeding swine***. For the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Live animals).\r\nProjections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 for the following categories: dairy and non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n*FAOSTAT livestock data include the items cattle and dairy cattle. Dairy cattle data are expressed as heads of cows producing milk, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item cow milk, whole fresh and the element producing animals. Non-dairy cattle is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as cattle minus dairy cattle;\r\n\r\n**FAOSTAT livestock data include the items chicken and chicken layers. Chicken layers are expressed in 1000 heads of hens which have laid eggs in the reference period, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item hen eggs, in shell and the element producing animals. Chickens broilers is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as chickens minus chickens layers;\r\n\r\n***FAOSTAT livestock data include the item pigs. Market and breeding swine are calculated respectively as 90% and 10% of item pigs (IPCC, 2006, Vol.4, Ch.10, Tab.10.19).\r\n\r\n(iii) Default IPCC percentages of total excreted N in different Manure Management Systems (MMS) by region and livestock category, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9 (for poultry: IPCC, 1997: Vol.3, Ch.4, Tab. 4.21). Specifically with reference to these tables, the amount of manure left on pasture contributing to GHG emissions is the sum of 100% of total excreted N left on pasture as per IPCC percentage value “Pasture/Range/Paddock”, and 50% of total excreted N as per IPCC percentage value “Burned for Fuel” (IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Chapter 10 Page 10.58).\r\n\r\n(2) Global default EF values taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Chapter 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nIndirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the fraction of manure N left on pastures that volatizes as NH3 and NOx and is lost through runoff and leaching in kg N yr-1 (3);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (4).\r\n\r\n(3) Obtained through the volatilization and leaching factors in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.3.\r\n\r\n(4) Global IPCC default EF values from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg N2O to Gg N2O; and\r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22). \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.

(http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gp/english/).\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from rice cultivation consist of methane gas (CH4) emitted by anaerobic decomposition of organic matter in paddy fields. The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 1997 Vol. 3, Ch. 4 and IPCC, 2000, Ch. 4.\r\nThe emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula:\r\nEmission = A * EF \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in g CH4 m-2 yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing rice paddy annual harvested area in m-2  (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, in g CH4 m-2 yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Activity data are disaggregated into irrigated, rain-fed and upland water regimes, using default IPCC percentages in IPCC, 1997, Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.11. For the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Crops) \r\nProjections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n(2) Seasonally integrated EF values are specified for key rice producing countries in the guidelines (IPCC, 1997: Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.13). For countries with no default value for EF, the following strategy is applied: for Asia, countries are assigned an area-weighted average EF (15.7 g CH4 m-2 yr-1); in all other regions, countries are either assigned the IPCC EF value reported for a neighbouring country, where one existed, or they are assigned the IPCC global default EF value (20 g CH4 m-2 yr-1). Furthermore, seasonally integrated EF values are further modified by the application of a dimensionless scaling factor for water regime (i) and a dimensionless correction factor for organic amendments (ii).\r\n\r\n(i) The scaling factors for rice paddy water regime (IPCC, 1997: Vol. 3, Ch. 4, Tab. 4.12) are in the range 0-1. Specifically for all countries a scaling factor of 0.7 is used for rain-fed rice and 0 for upland rice or dry conditions (IPCC, 2000: Tab. 3, page 403).\r\n\r\n(ii) The correction factor for organic amendments is the default value of 2 for all countries, corresponding to the assumption that 40% of farmers use organic amendments (IPCC, 2000: Tab. 3, page 403).\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n10-4, to convert the activity data from m-2  to ha;\r\n10-9, to convert the emissions from g CH4 to Gg CH4; and\r\nGWP-CH4 = 21 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg CH4 to Gg CO2eq.

See 20.5 for more details.\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions from manure applied to soils consist of direct and indirect nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from manure nitrogen (N) added to agricultural soils by farmers. Specifically, N2O is produced by microbial processes of nitrification and de-nitrification taking place on the application site (direct emissions), and after volatilization/re-deposition and leaching processes (indirect emissions). The FAOSTAT data are estimated at Tier 1 following the IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 10 and 11.\r\n\r\nDirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF  \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg N2O-N yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the total amount of N in manure applied to soils in kg N yr-1 (1);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors in kg N2O-N/kg N yr-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) It is the amount of N excreted (see below, note i) by livestock (ii), treated in manure management systems (MMS) (iii) and net of losses through volatilization, runoff and leaching from MMS, and other human use (iv), plus the N contribution from bedding materials when present (v). \r\n\r\n(i) Following IPCC,2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Eq. 10.30, the total amount of N excreted by each livestock category is calculated multiplying the number of livestock heads by two coefficients: a) the Typical Animal Mass (TAM) and b) the N excretion coefficient (Nex). Both parameters vary according to geographic region. TAM values are obtained from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9; Nex values are derived from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 10.19. \r\n\r\n(ii) Livestock data cover the following animal categories: buffalo, sheep, goats, camels, llamas, horses, mules, asses, ducks, turkeys, dairy and non-dairy cattle*, chickens layers and broilers** and market and breeding swine***. \r\n\r\nFor the period 1961-present, activity data are taken directly from FAOSTAT (domain: Production/Live animals). Projections of activity data for 2030 and 2050 for the following categories: dairy and non-dairy cattle, buffaloes, sheep, goats, pigs and poultry, are computed with respect to a baseline, defined as the 2005-2007 average of the corresponding FAOSTAT activity data, and by applying percentage growth rates from FAO perspective studies (Alexandratos and Bruinsma, 2012). Activity data for animal categories for which FAO projections were not available were set to the most recent available FAOSTAT value. The FAO projections used cover some 140 countries. Projections of activity data for countries not included assume the same growth rate of neighboring countries.\r\n\r\n*FAOSTAT livestock data include the items cattle and dairy cattle. Dairy cattle data are expressed as heads of cows producing milk, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item cow milk, whole fresh and the element producing animals. Non-dairy cattle is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as cattle minus dairy cattle;\r\n\r\n**FAOSTAT livestock data include the items chicken and chicken layers. Chicken layers are expressed in 1000 heads of hens which have laid eggs in the reference period, and can be found under the domain Production/Livestock Primary by selecting the item hen eggs, in shell and the element producing animals. chickens broilers is derived from FAOSTAT categories, specifically as chickens minus chickens layers;\r\n\r\n***FAOSTAT livestock data include the item pigs. Market and breeding swine are calculated respectively as 90% and 10% of item pigs (IPCC, 2006, Vol.4, Ch.10, Tab.10.19).\r\n\r\n(iii) Default IPCC percentages of total N treated in different MMS, by region and livestock category, are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Annex 10A.2 Tabs. 10A-4 to 10A-9 (for poultry: IPCC, 1997: Vol. 3, Ch.4, Tab. 4.21). \r\n\r\n(iv) Default IPCC values for total N losses from different MMS depend on the livestock category as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, Tab. 23. Losses of treated manure due to use for construction, feed or fuel are set to zero, as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, page 11.13. It is assumed that all treated manure, net of the above losses, is applied to soils following IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, page 11.13. \r\n\r\n(v) Default amounts of N used in bedding (for solid storage and deep bedding) as per IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 10, page 10.66.\r\n\r\n(2) Global IPCC default EF values are taken from IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1.\r\n\r\nIndirect emissions are estimated at country level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF\r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = GHG emissions in kg yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the fraction of manure N applications that volatizes as NH3 and NOx and is lost through runoff and leaching in kg N yr-1 (3);\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors in kg N2O-N / kg N yr-1 (4).\r\n\r\n(3) Obtained through the volatilization and leaching factors in IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11,  Tab. 11.3. \r\n\r\n(4) Global IPCC default EF values from IPCC, 2006: Vol.4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.3.\r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg N2O to Gg N2O; and\r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 pg. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\nAlexandratos, N. and J.

      "EN" : "\"GHG emissions data from cultivation of organic soils are those associated with nitrous oxide gas from cultivated organic soils under cropland (item: cropland organic soils) and grassland (item: grassland organic soils). \r\nFAOSTAT emission estimates are computed at Tier 1 following the IPCC 2006 Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/2006gl/vol4.html).\r\nGHG emissions are provided by country, region and sepcial groups, with global coverage, relative to the period 1990-present (with annual updates) and with projections for 2030 and 2050, expressed both as Gg N2O and Gg CO2eq, by cropland, grassland and by the two aggregated. Implied emission factor for N2O as well activity data (areas) are also provided.\"\r\n\r\n\"This sub-domain contains data on GHG emissions, associated emission factors and underlying activity data. The GHG emission estimates refer to the year 2000, corresponding to the reference year of the land cover map used (EC-JRC, 2003). Values for the year 2000 are replicated over the entire time series 1990-present, including projections for 2030 and 2050.\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions data are estimates by FAO and do not coincide with GHG data reported by member countries to UNFCCC. The database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international tool for QA/QC procedures and data analysis. The FAOSTAT Emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments:\r\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions database was produced by the FAO Monitoring and Assessment of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Mitigation Potential in Agriculture project (MAGHG), with generous funding from the Governments of Norway and Germany, trust funds GCP/GLO/286/GER and GCP/GLO/325/NOR.\"\r\n\r\n"

See 20.5 for more details\r\n\r\n\"When no activity (source) data is available, FAOSTAT emissions database results in no data (i.e. no imputations are made) .\r\n\r\nGHG emissions data from cultivation of organic soils are those associated with nitrous oxide gas from cultivated organic soils under cropland (item: cropland organic soils) and grassland (item: grassland organic soils). The FAOSTAT data are computed at Tier 1 following IPCC, 2006, Vol. 4, Ch. 11.\r\n\r\nThe emissions are estimated at pixel level, using the formula: \r\nEmission = A * EF  \r\nwhere:\r\nEmission = Annual emissions, in units of kg N2O–N yr-1;\r\nA = Activity data, representing the annual area of cultivated organic soils, in hectares (1).\r\nEF = Tier 1, default IPCC emission factors, expressed in units of kg N2O–N ha-1 (2).\r\n\r\n(1) Data are obtained through the stratification of three different global datasets:\r\n\r\ni. The Harmonized World Soil Database (FAO et al., 2012), used to estimate the area covered by Histosols classes. \r\n\r\nii. The Global Land Cover dataset, GLC2000 (EC-JRC, 2003), used to estimate the amount of cropland and grassland area in each pixel. \r\nFor cropland, three “cropland” classes from GLC2000 are used following You et al. (2008):\r\n\r\nCLASS - NAME CROPLAND - SHARE PER PIXEL\r\n16 - Cultivated and managed areas - 100%\r\n17 - Mosaic: cropland/tree cover/Other natural vegetation - 50%\r\n18 - Mosaic: cropland/Shrub and/or grass cover - 10%\r\n\r\nFor grassland, two “herbaceous” and two mosaics GLC2000 classes are used, in line with the FAO Land Cover Classification Scheme (LCCS) (FAO, 2014):\r\n\r\nCLASS - NAME GRASSLAND - SHARE PER PIXEL\r\n13 - Herbaceous Cover, closed-open - 100%\r\n14 - Sparse herbaceous or sparse shrub cover - 50%\r\n17 - Mosaic: Cropland / Tree Cover / Other natural vegetation - 25%\r\n18 - Mosaic: Cropland / Shrub and/or grass cover - 45%\r\n\r\niii. The Gridded Livestock of the World for cattle and sheep (Wint and Robinson, 2007), used as an additional mask over grassland organic soils as a proxy to estimate drained area. With this mask, only those pixels with non-zero grassland histosols area and livestock density >1 head/ha are included.\r\nFor the period 1990-present the activity data reported in this sub-domain is a constant value, representing the year 2000, i.e., the reference year of the GLC2000 database.\r\n\r\n(2) The EF values are those specified in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 11, Tab. 11.1. The EF were assigned at pixel level in order to distinguish the relevant climate zone, as defined in IPCC, 2006: Vol. 4, Ch. 3, Annex 3A.5, using the climatic zones map from the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission (EC-JRC, 2010).\r\nThe analysis was carried out in GIS, combining the above datasets. GHG estimates made at pixel level were subsequently aggregated at country level, using the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) dataset. \r\n\r\nDimensionless conversion factors used are:\r\n44/28, to convert the emissions from kg N2O-N to kg N2O gas;\r\n10-6, to convert the emissions from kg N2O to Gg N2O; and\r\nGWP-N2O = 310 (100-year time horizon global warming potential), to convert Gg N2O to Gg CO2eq (IPCC, 1996: Technical Summary, Tab. 4 page 22).\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\nEC-JRC. 2003.

      "EN" : "The FAO indices of agricultural production show the relative level of the aggregate volume of agricultural production for each year in comparison with the base period 2004-2006. They are based on the sum of price-weighted quantities of different agricultural commodities produced after deductions of quantities used as seed and feed weighted in a similar manner. The resulting aggregate represents, therefore, disposable production for any use except as seed and feed. All the indices at the country, regional and world levels are calculated by the Laspeyres formula. Production quantities of each commodity are weighted by 2004-2006 average international commodity prices and summed for each year. To obtain the index, the aggregate for a given year is divided by the average aggregate for the base period 2004-2006. Since the FAO indices are based on the concept of agriculture as a single enterprise, amounts of seed and feed are subtracted from the production data to avoid double counting them, once in the production data and once with the crops or livestock produced from them. Deductions for seed (in the case of eggs, for hatching) and for livestock and poultry feed apply to both domestically produced and imported commodities. They cover only primary agricultural products destined to animal feed (e.g. maize, potatoes, milk, etc.). Processed and semi-processed feed items such as bran, oilcakes, meals and molasses have been completely excluded from the calculations at all stages. It should be noted that when calculating indices of agricultural, food and non-food production, all intermediate primary inputs of agricultural origin are deducted. However, for indices of any other commodity group, only inputs originating from within the same group are deducted; thus, only seed is removed from the group “crops” and from all crop subgroups, such as cereals, oil crops, etc.; and both feed and seed originating from within the livestock sector (e.g. milk feed, hatching eggs) are removed from the group “livestock products”. For the main two livestock subgroups, namely, meat and milk, only feed originating from the respective subgroup is removed. The \"international commodity prices” are used in order to avoid the use of exchange rates for obtaining continental and world aggregates, and also to improve and facilitate international comparative analysis of productivity at the national level. These” international prices”, expressed in so-called \"international dollars”, are derived using a Geary-Khamis formula for the agricultural sector. This method assigns a single “price” to each commodity. For example, one metric ton of wheat has the same price regardless of the country where it was produced. The currency unit in which the prices are expressed has no influence on the indices published. The commodities covered in the computation of indices of agricultural production are all crops and livestock products originating in each country. Practically all products are covered, with the main exception of fodder crops. The category of food production includes commodities that are considered edible and that contain nutrients. Accordingly, coffee and tea are excluded along with inedible commodities because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. Indices for meat production are computed based on data for production from indigenous animals, which takes account of the meat equivalent of exported live animals but excludes the meat equivalent of imported live animals. For index purposes, annual changes in livestock and poultry numbers or in their average live weight are not taken into account. The indices are calculated from production data presented on a calendar year basis. The FAO indices may differ from those produced by the countries themselves because of differences in concepts of production, coverage, weights, time reference of data and methods of calculation.\r\n"

Thus, value of production measures production in monetary terms at the farm gate level. Since intermediate uses within the agricultural sector (seed and feed) have not been subtracted from production data, this value of production aggregate refers to the notion of \"gross production\". Value of gross production is provided in both current and constant terms and is expressed in US dollars and Standard Local Currency (SLC). The current value of production measures value in the prices relating to the period being measured. Thus, it represents the market value of food and agricultural products at the time they were produced. Knowing this figure is helpful in understanding exactly what was happening within a given economy at that point in time. Often, this information can help explain economic trends that emerged in later periods and why they took place. Value of production in constant terms is derived using the average prices of a selected year or years, known as the base period. Constant price series can be used to show how the quantity or volume of products has changed, and are often referred to as volume measures. The ratio of the current and constant price series gives a measure of price movements. US dollar figures for value of gross production are converted from local currencies using official exchange rates as prevailing in the respective years. The SLC of a country is the local currency prevailing in the latest year. Expressing data series in one uniform currency is useful because it avoids the influence of revaluation in local currency, if any, on value of production. Please note that livestock value of production is measured in terms of indigenous meat.\r\n"

Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients.\r\n"

It covers total pesticides and relevant break-down: insecticides, fungicides, herbicides, disinfectants as well as anti-sprouting products and plant-growth regulators. Starting in the year 2007 it has been introduced a new variable to cover the trade of certain hazardous pesticides that are subject to the Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure. This variable, “Hazardous pesticides”, relates to the HS code 3808.50 and covers mixtures preparations containing the substance subject to PIC procedure. The pesticides trade dataset also includes the pure substances that are subject to the PIC procedure; these are reported starting in the year 2007 for import/export quantity (NetWeight (kg)) and value (1000 US$). Rotterdam Convention on the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in International Trade: The Convention was initiated by FAO and UNEP in 1989 and entered into force on 24 February 2004. The Convention establishes a legally binding obligation to enable countries to decide which potentially hazardous chemicals they want to import /export and to exclude those they cannot manage safely. Please see the correspondence table of the pure substances in Pesticides (trade) http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/RT/*/E). In 2011, import value relating to the aggregated variable \"Pesticides\" is available for 202 countries and the relevant regional, continental and world totals according to country classification of United Nations M-49 list. On the other hand, regional, continental and world totals are not calculated for the remaining variables due to incomplete country coverage.\r\n\r\n",

      "EN" : "Article I of the constitution indeed requires the Organization to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate information relating to nutrition, food and agriculture (the term “agriculture” and its derivatives includes forestry, fisheries and aquaculture). The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: “If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients. FAO, through ESS, is member of the Task Force of International Merchandise Trade Statistics (TF-IMTS) coordinated by UNSD and contributes together with other international organizations to improve the IMTS methodology as well as to implement it at the country level. FAO through ESS is also member of the Expert Group of Global Trade Statistics together with other international organizations and selected countries.\r\n\"FAO trade statistics follows the international standards provided by the IMTS which is periodically revised by UNSD with the contribution of other international organizations and the member countries. The original version was issued in 1970 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.70.XVII.16) and the first revised\r\nversion in 1982 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.82.XVII.14) . At its forty-first session, the Statistical Commission adopted International\r\nMerchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts And Definitions, 2010 (IMTS 2010)1 and\r\nendorsed the proposed implementation programme, including the preparation of the revision of International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Compilers Manual2 and supporting technical assistance activities (see E/2010/24, chap. I.B, decision 41/103, para. (b)). In the same decision (para. (c)), the Commission requested the Expert Group on International Merchandise Trade Statistics and the Task Force on International Merchandise Trade Statistics to continue their work, focus on the implementation of IMTS 2010 and give due consideration to national circumstances, the harmonization of national and regional compilation practices and the conduct of related comparison studies.

In FAOSTAT database the unit value is expressed in US dollars per tonne, US dollars per live animal or US dollars per 1 000 heads in the case of poultry, rabbits, pigeons and other birds. Agricultural import/export quantity/value index: Quantity/value indices represent the changes in the price-weighted sum of quantities of food and agriculture products traded between countries. The weights are the unit value averages of 2004-2006. The formulas used are of the Laspeyres type. Indices for food products include commodities that are considered edible and contain nutrients, except for animal feed products and alcoholic beverages. Coffee and tea are also excluded because, although edible, they have practically no nutritive value. For countries which report import values on f.o.b. (free on board) basis, these are adjusted to approximate c.i.f. values (by a standard factor of 112 percent). Agricultural import/export unit value index: Unit value indices represent the changes in the quantity-weighted unit values of products traded between countries. The weights are the quantity averages of 2004-2006. The formulas used are of the Laspeyres type.

The first session of the FAO Conference in 1945 provided the rationale: “If FAO is to carry out its work successfully it will need to know where and why hunger and malnutrition exist, what forms they take, and how widespread they are. Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients. FAO, through ESS, is member of the Task Force of International Merchandise Trade Statistics (TF-IMTS) coordinated by UNSD and contributes together with other international organizations to improve the IMTS methodology as well as to implement it at the country level. FAO through ESS is also member of the Expert Group of Global Trade Statistics together with other international organizations and selected countries.\r\n\"FAO trade statistics follows the international standards provided by the IMTS which is periodically revised by UNSD with the contribution of other international organizations and the member countries. The original version was issued in 1970 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.70.XVII.16) and the first revised\r\nversion in 1982 (United Nations publication, Sales No. E.82.XVII.14) . At its forty-first session, the Statistical Commission adopted International\r\nMerchandise Trade Statistics: Concepts And Definitions, 2010 (IMTS 2010)1 and\r\nendorsed the proposed implementation programme, including the preparation of the revision of International Merchandise Trade Statistics: Compilers Manual2 and supporting technical assistance activities (see E/2010/24, chap. I.B, decision 41/103, para. (b)). In the same decision (para. (c)), the Commission requested the Expert Group on International Merchandise Trade Statistics and the Task Force on International Merchandise Trade Statistics to continue their work, focus on the implementation of IMTS 2010 and give due consideration to national circumstances, the harmonization of national and regional compilation practices and the conduct of related comparison studies.

Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients.

Such data will serve as a basis for making plans, determining the efficacy of measures used, and measuring progress from time to time.” Member countries reaffirmed this mandate in 2000 when formulating the Organization’s strategic thrusts for the 2000-2015 period: Corporate Strategy E1 commits the Organization to building “an integrated information resource base, with current, relevant and reliable statistics, information and knowledge made accessible to all FAO clients.

It should be noted, however, that accuracy and comparability is very much dependent on customs practices, definitions and policies in individual countries. It shold also be noted that of all the customs activities only a few dimensions are collected purely for statistical purpose.\r\n"

The compilation of the data and the production of the above mentioned statistics follow the recommendations (sources and methods) of different international organisations, i.e. Eurostat, International Monetary Fund (IMF), United Nations (UN), etc. The Quality Report on International Trade Statistics documents the main differences between these sources in terms of concepts and definitions, statistical unit or object, classification used, geographical breakdown, reference period and correction methods.\r\nThe internal coherence of data are generally good.\r\n"

In general all goods should be valued with the total amount which would be invoiced in case of sale or purchase at the national border of the reporting country. The statistical value does not include taxes on export or import, such as customs duties, value added tax, excise duty, levies, export refunds or other taxes with similar effect. It includes only incidental expenses (freight, insurance) incurred, in the case of exports/dispatches, in the part of the journey located on the territory of the reporting Member State and, in the case of imports/arrivals, in the part of the journey located outside the territory of the reporting country. It is said to be a FOB value (free on board), for exports/dispatches, and a CIF value (cost, insurance, freight) for imports/arrivals.\r\n"
